I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a condensed view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the deatailed view

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

I can filter bookmarks by all or individually by star rating
